# ImageSearch v2

Same as [this one](https://github.com/InkAurora/ImageSearch-CPP) but with support to searching multiple images at once and also the same image at multiple positions.

Receives a `vector<string>` containing the paths to the images and will output by reference a `vector<string> ("x, y")` containing the position of all matches.


Speed is not a priority in this project. If speed concerns you, try [the prior version](https://github.com/InkAurora/ImageSearch-CPP).

Also same as before, only .bmp files are supported.
